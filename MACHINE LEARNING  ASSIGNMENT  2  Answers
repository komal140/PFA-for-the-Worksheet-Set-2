Q13 to Q15 are subjective answers type questions, Answers them in their own words briefly

13. Is K sensitive to outliers? 
Answer : 
K-Means clustering algorithm is most sensitive to outliers as it uses the mean of cluster data points to find the cluster center.

14. Why is K means better? 
Answer : 
    K-means has been around since the 1970s and fares better than other clustering algorithms like density-based, expectation-maximisation. It is one of the most robust methods, especially for image segmentation and image annotation projects

15. Is K means a deterministic algorithm? 
Answer : 
    The basic k-means clustering is based on a non-deterministic algorithm. This means that running the algorithm several times on the same data, could give different results. However, to ensure consistent results, FCS Express performs k-means clustering using a deterministic method.
